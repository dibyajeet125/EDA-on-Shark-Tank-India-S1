# EDA-on-Shark-Tank-India-S1

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Shark Tank India dataset, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. It begins by loading the dataset and performing data exploration tasks like checking for missing values, describing the data, and categorizing companies based on investment received. Then visualizes various aspects of the dataset, including the distribution of investments, brands involved in multi-shark deals, highest and lowest pitch amounts, equity distribution, and success rates by individual sharks. Additionally, it explores correlations between pitch valuations and deal valuations, average equity offered, and relationships between investment amounts, equity offered, and deal valuations. Then concludes with a comparison of successful and unsuccessful pitches based on average valuations. These visualizations offer valuable insights into investment trends, success rates, and pitch valuation dynamics on Shark Tank India.
